config BLERPC_DEVICE_NAME
	string "BLE device name for advertising"
	default "blerpc"

config BLERPC_TIMEOUT_MS
	int "Default timeout in milliseconds"
	default 100
	help
	  Default timeout value reported to Central via timeout control container.

config BLERPC_MAX_RESPONSE_PAYLOAD_SIZE
	int "Maximum response payload size"
	default 65535
	help
	  Maximum response payload size reported to Central via capabilities
	  control container. The streaming encoder has no buffer limit, so this
	  defaults to the protocol maximum (65535).

config BLERPC_WORK_STACK_SIZE
	int "Work queue stack size"
	default MAIN_STACK_SIZE
	help
	  Stack size for the blerpc request processing work queue.

config BLERPC_MAX_FLASH_READ_ADDRESS
	int "Maximum allowed flash read address"
	default 0
	help
	  Maximum address (exclusive) allowed for BLE flash_read requests.
	  Set to 0 to allow reading up to the end of flash (limited by
	  hardware flash size). Set to a specific address to restrict
	  reads to a safe region (e.g. application data area only).

config BLERPC_DOUBLE_BUFFER
	bool "Double-buffer request work queue"
	default n
	help
	  When enabled, uses two request_work buffers instead of one,
	  allowing a new request to be received while the previous one
	  is still being processed. This costs ~12KB extra RAM.
	  When disabled, a BUSY error is sent if a request arrives
	  while the previous one is still being processed.

config BLERPC_ENCRYPTION
	bool "Enable E2E encryption"
	default n
	depends on BLERPC_PROTOCOL_CRYPTO
	help
	  Enable E2E encryption on the peripheral.
	  X25519 keypair is generated ephemerally per session for forward secrecy.
	  Requires Ed25519 private key for authentication.

config BLERPC_ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY
	string "Ed25519 private key seed (hex, 64 chars)"
	default ""
	depends on BLERPC_ENCRYPTION
	help
	  Peripheral Ed25519 private key seed as hex string (32 bytes = 64 hex chars).
	  This key is used for device authentication (signing).
	  Store this in a git-ignored overlay file (e.g. keys.conf), not prj.conf.
